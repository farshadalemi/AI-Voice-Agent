businesses (id, name, industry, settings, created_at)
plans (id, name, features, pricing, limits)
subscriptions (business_id, plan_id, status, usage)
users (id, business_id, role, permissions)

-- Voice agent configuration
agents (id, business_id, name, voice_settings, personality)
knowledge_bases (id, business_id, version, status)
conversations (id, agent_id, customer_phone, transcript, metadata)

-- Integration settings
integrations (id, business_id, type, config, credentials)
webhooks (id, business_id, url, events, secret)
```

### Vector Database (Pinecone/Weaviate)
- Business-specific knowledge embeddings
- Conversation history vectors
- Product/service information
- FAQ and policy documents

### File Storage (S3/MinIO)
- Audio recordings (training samples)
- Business documents
- Voice models
- Conversation recordings
